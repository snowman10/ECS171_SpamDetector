To run our program, run "python main.py" or "python3 main.py" depending on whichever version of python has the most recent version. At the bottom of the main python file, it has the option to run the main function or two other functions. Comment out all other functions and only allow it to run main().

NOTE: It should be like this by default. By default, you should be able to just run the file. It takes a few seconds to run each model but everything should be functional. Each button loads a model, you need to press submit to analyze the message.
